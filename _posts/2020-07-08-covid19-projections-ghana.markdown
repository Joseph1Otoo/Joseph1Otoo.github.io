On the 14th of March, 2020, Ghana recorded the first case of  Covid-19. This event was preceded by the first address by the president  of the republic on enhanced measures taken in response to the pandemic.

Days and weeks after the first incidence of covid-19, there have been several measures put in place to curb the rate of covid-19 infections  in the country. Some of the measures were closure of schools, partial  lock-down of portions of the country, enhanced contact tracing and  testing, mandatory wearing of face mask, closure of churches and mosques etc.

In spite of all the measures implemented, new covid-19 cases are on  the increase. Information from the government  suggest that there is a  growing workplace infections. In the wake of the growth or spikes in the new covid-19 cases in the country, one question that comes to play is  that, when will the infections peak?	

The time series plots of new covid-19 cases in Ghana gives a different indication with regards to when the infection will peak.
